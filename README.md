# TeachersList
The teacher is able to do the following:
Persist or store the details of each student in the database. A student has a photo, name, surname, 
age, gender, student number, and a list of subjects done. The photo must be read from the local 
drive. A student can do one, two, three, four,â€¦ subjects. The number of subjects done by the 
student is not known in advance. Each persisted record must also include the timestamp.  
Search for a student in the database using the student number as the search key. If found, the photo 
of the student, name, surname, age, gender, student number and the list of subjects done must be 
displayed. If not found, an appropriate message must be displayed. 
 View   all the students in the database. Again, for each student, the photo, name, surname, age, 
gender, student number and a list of subjects done must be displayed. 
Delete or remove a specific student from the database using the student number as the search key. 
Determine and display the number of students stored in the database.
